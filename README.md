This is a VIM plugin for using JSON in a way that I like. It is a fork of [vim-scripts/vim-json-bundle][], which is a fork of [leshill/vim-json][].

Everything apparently works well with [pathogen][], but, while that seems like a great tool, I haven't tried it yet. I only recently learned of its existence.
